Superstore Sales Prediction Of Office Supplies Products

**Objective**: The primary goal is to forecast monthly sales for office supplies products at a global superstore using historical data spanning four years (2015-2018).

**Data Description**: The dataset comprises detailed records of sales transactions from a global superstore over four years. Notably, the products are categorized into three main groups: Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies. For this analysis, the focus is specifically on the 'Office Supplies' category.

**Prediction Horizon**: The models will be tasked with predicting the sales for a future horizon of six months. This specific timeframe is chosen to provide actionable insights for short-term strategic planning.

**Future implementation**
Overall We got the better result with Auto Arima model.
Our Future Implementation is SARIMAX model and compared with the AUTO ARIMA model.
After comparing both models we will do EX-ANTE forecasting of future sales.
